//# Tuples in TypeScript
//? Tuples are a type of array that allows you to express an array where the type of a fixed number of elements is known, but need not be the same.

//# make tuple readonly  so that new values cannot be added to the instances of tuples.

	return `Product name:${p[0]} Type:${p[1]} Price:${p[2]} Quantity:${p[3]}`;
